## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
In The Empire Strikes Back project, I used the Pygame package to develop a 2D game in which the aim is to shoot down a fleet of Tie Fighters as they drop down the screen in levels that increase in speed and difficulty. 

The TIE starfighter, simply known as the TIE Fighter or T/F, was the standard Imperial starfighter seen in massive numbers throughout most of the Galactic Civil War and onward.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
The following are the necessary tools needed to run/extend the current project:

* [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - python interpreter

### Installing

 - Linux/MacOs:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
 - Windows:
   ```bash
   ./setup.bat
   ```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
To run the game and test your skills first activate the ```test-env``` virtual environment:
