## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
In The Empire Strikes Back project, I used the Pygame package to develop a 2D game in which the aim is to shoot down a fleet of Tie Fighters as they drop down the screen in levels that increase in speed and difficulty. 

The TIE starfighter, simply known as the TIE Fighter or T/F, was the standard Imperial starfighter seen in massive numbers throughout most of the Galactic Civil War and onward.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
The following are the necessary tools needed to run/extend the current project:

* [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - python interpreter

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Add notes about how to use the system.
