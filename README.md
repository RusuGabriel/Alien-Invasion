## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
In The Empire Strikes Back project, I used the Pygame package to develop a 2D game in which the aim is to shoot down a fleet of Tie Fighters as they drop down the screen in levels that increase in speed and difficulty. 

The TIE starfighter, simply known as the TIE Fighter or T/F, was the standard Imperial starfighter seen in massive numbers throughout most of the Galactic Civil War and onward.
